Our laboratory is dedicated to understanding the biomechanics, neuromuscular control and clinical rehabilitation of human mobility, with an emphasis on dexterous hand function. Towards this end, we employ a synergy of experimental and theoretical techniques.

Our diverse experimental arsenal ranges from EMG recording and custom-made virtual reality modules, detailed characterization of multifinger structure and function, to mapping the function of the human brain with fMRI. These procedures in turn inform theoretical work to characterize complex sensorimotor function through rigorous and anatomically faithful mathematical models.

# Jun Yong Shin 
Designing a wireless data collection system so signals from various sensors (such as accelerator, gyroscope, and load cells) are wirelessly transmitted to a mobile device for visualization of all waveforms in real time. This will ameliorate data collection and analysis across multiple areas of kinesiology.
