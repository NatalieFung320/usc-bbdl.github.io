    <p>Brain-Body Dynamics Lab 
at the University of Southern California </p>

<center><b>Research topics</b></center>

<p>The Brain-Body Dynamics Lab, led by Prof. Francisco Valero-Cuevas, is dedicated to understanding neuromuscular control and the interaction between neural systems and biomechanical/robotic systems. Our laboratory is accepting applications for NIH funded post-doctoral fellowships to understand the neuromuscular control of complex tendon-driven systems, and reverse-engineer brain function in collaboration with Profs. Terry Sanger, and Jerry Loeb. In particular, we are looking for candidates to implement models of neural circuitry and muscle function (in simulation and FPGAs) to control hardware-in-the loop systems. Successful applicants will have strong backgrounds in control and estimation of nonlinear systems, computational neuroscience, mechatronics, computational methods, robotics, and/or biomechanical modeling. Expertise in computer languages (e.g., C, C++, MATLAB) is necessary. </p>

<center><b>Environment</b></center>

<p>Our laboratory consists of an interdisciplinary group of graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, clinicians, and faculty in engineering, computer science, mathematics and bioengineering. </p>

<p>Further information about our laboratory can be found at: <a href="https://usc-bbdl.github.io/">usc-bbdl.github.io</a> </p>

<center><b>Curriculum and training</b></center>

<p>The candidate should have a Ph.D. in engineering, bioengineering or neuroscience; and a strong interest in neuromuscular control. She/he must have experience in at least two of the following: control &amp; estimation of nonlinear or biological systems; computational modeling; and experimental design of electromechanical systems. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in neuroscience. Expertise in computer languages (e.g., C++, MATLAB, etc) is necessary. </p>

<center><b>Applications process</b></center>

<p>For consideration, please submit your application (preferably in one single PDF document) including cover letter, a full CV, a statement of research interests and career goals and the names and email addresses of three references to <a href="mailto:ellawren@usc.edu" target="_top">Emily Lawrence</a>. Please write “Postdoctoral/Research Associate Position” in the subject line. </p>

<p>The position is available immediately, and applications will be received until the position is filled. The University of Southern California offers competitive salary and benefits.</p>
