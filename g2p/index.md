A tendon-driven robotic limb learns movements autonomously from sparse experience, by a short period of ‘motor babbling’ (that is, repeated exploratory movements), followed by a phase of reinforcement learning. In the photo, the limb is learning to make cyclic movements to propel the treadmill. The approach is a step towards designing robots with the versatility and robustness of vertebrates, which can adapt quickly to everyday environments.
