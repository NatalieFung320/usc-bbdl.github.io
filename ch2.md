Abstract Thepurposeofthischapteristointroduceyoutothekinematicsoflimbs. Kinematics is the study of movements without regard to the forces and torques that produce them. In essence, it is the fundamental description of the articulations and motions of which a limb is capable. This chapter serves as the foundation upon which we can build a common conceptual language, and begin to discuss limb function in the context of mechanics.
