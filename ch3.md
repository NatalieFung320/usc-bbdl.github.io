# Chapter 3: Limb Mechanics  (*under construction*)
*Last updated Dec. 26 2015 by Francisco Valero-Cuevas*

**Abstract:**
_________

~~~
Limb mechanics involve limb kinematics, and the forces and torques that cause limb loading and motion. Mechanics can be both static and dynamic depending on whether motion is prevented or not, respectively. Studying limb motions that result from applied forces and torques falls within the realm of rigid-body dynamics, which is a specialized branch of mechanics. However, I will mostly consider the case of static mechanics because it suffices to illustrate and debate important concepts in neuromechanics. This chapter focuses on presenting some fundamental concepts of how limbs produce static forces.
