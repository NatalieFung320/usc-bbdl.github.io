# Why did we choose Jekyll?

```
The main advantages of Jekyll are:

-You can use Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is simpler to read and write.
-You can use common templates, such as headers and footers, that are shared across files.
-You can use a simplified build process to build your site with GitHub Pages.
-You can automatically compress all images across the site for consistency in performance.
