### **Abstract:**
We present a conceptual and computational framework to unify today's theories of neuromuscular control called feasibility theory.
We begin by describing how the musculoskeletal anatomy of the limb, the need to control individual tendons, and the physics of a motor task uniquely specify the family of all valid muscle activations that accomplish it (its `feasible activation space').
For our example of static force production with a finger with seven muscles, computational geometry characterizes, in a complete way, the structure of  feasible activation spaces as 3-dimensional polytopes embedded in 7-D.
The feasible activation space for a given task is _the_ landscape where all neuromuscular learning, control, and performance must occur.
This approach unifies current theories of neuromuscular control because the structure of feasible activation spaces can be separately approximated as either low-dimensional basis functions (synergies), high-dimensional joint probability distributions (Bayesian priors), or fitness landscapes (to optimize cost functions).
