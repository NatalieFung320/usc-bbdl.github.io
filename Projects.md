	  	<b>Reverse engineering fingertip motor control</b><br>
		<a href="../about/#briancohn">Brian Cohn</a>, <a href="../about/#kianjalaleddini">Kian Jalaleddini Ph.D.</a><br>
		How do we learn to manipulate forces in spite of having squishy tendon-driven limbs? We are exploring how the mechanics of biology define the dimensionality of control. We achieve this with robotic and cadaveric studies, pulling on tendons, and identifying how muscle forces contribute to fingertip forces.<br>

	  	<b>Analysis of different movement trajectories</b> <br>
		<a href="../about/#danhagen">Dan Hagen</a><br>
		When it comes to free throws, what's the difference between a good shot, and a good looking shot? We are delving into the high dimensionality surrounding the many ways that an arm can shoot a basketball, and are uncovering the limitations of muscle control for different trajectories.<br>

		<b>Squishy-Meta</b><br>
		<a href="../about/#briancohn">Brian Cohn</a>, <a href="../about/#kianjalaleddini">Kian Jalaleddini</a><br>
		How is the control of squishy, non-linear robots different than the control of stiff, revolute robots? Do the algorithms for controlling each work when applied to the other?<br>
